Prompt Detective is an advanced forensic tool designed to bring transparency to the digital world. In an age where AI-generated content is becoming indistinguishable from human work, this tool provides a crucial service: determining the origin of content and images.

### ‚ú® Key Features:

* **AI vs. Human Verdict:** Upload an image, paste text, or provide a URL, and Prompt Detective will analyze the content for digital 'fingerprints' to deliver a clear verdict: "Likely AI-Generated" or "Likely Human-Created."
* **Reverse-Engineer the Prompt:** Our core feature. The tool reveals a detailed, plausible prompt that could have been used to create the analyzed content. This allows users to understand the creative blueprint and even reuse the prompt to generate similar high-quality content.
* **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Go beyond the verdict with a breakdown of *why* the tool reached its conclusion, listing specific indicators of AI or human origin.
* **Multiple Input Methods:** Supports image/text analysis via direct upload, paste, or URL fetching for maximum flexibility.
