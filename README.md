# Prompt Detective

**From creation to code: We find the prompt.**

Prompt Detective is an advanced forensic tool designed to bring transparency to the digital world. In an age where AI-generated content is becoming indistinguishable from human work, this tool provides a crucial service: determining the origin of content and images.

### Key Features:

* **AI vs. Human Verdict:** Upload an image, paste text, or provide a URL, and Prompt Detective will analyze the content for digital fingerprints to deliver a clear verdict: "Likely AI-Generated" or "Likely Human-Created."
* **Reverse-Engineer the Prompt:** Our core USP. The tool reveals a detailed, plausible prompt that could have been used to create the analyzed content. This allows users to understand the creative blueprint and even reuse the prompt to generate similar high-quality content themselves.
* **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Go beyond the verdict with a breakdown of *why* the tool reached its conclusion, listing specific indicators of AI or human origin.

Prompt Detective empowers users to get a fair answer about content originality and provides them with the exact creative instructions to replicate and build upon what they see.
